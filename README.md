# LangChainVectorAgent
A LangChain Agent integrating vector-based semantic search with interactive visualization.

This project implements a LangChain agent that leverages vector search techniques (e.g., FAISS, cosine similarity) to retrieve relevant information from document embeddings, combined with intuitive t-SNE visualizations to explore the search results in a 2D or 3D space. It supports:

Efficient semantic retrieval using vector stores

Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and cosine similarity search methods

Interactive plotting with Plotly for understanding relationships between query and results

Memory management for multi-turn conversational context

Ideal for building intelligent conversational assistants that can explain and visualize their reasoning on knowledge bases.
